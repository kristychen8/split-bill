# Split Bill
### Allows one to split a bill between friends.

In a scenario where a group of friends go to a restaurant, they will order different items and some may share dishes. In most cases, one person would take the bill and charge everyone afterwards. However, it is unfair to split the bill evenly if one person ate a $10 dish versus the other who shared multiple dishes and ordered expensive items.

This website application will determine each individual's bill. It allows you to input the bill's item, the item's price and select the friends that need to pay for the item. You can choose your tip and tax percentage, and the two will be calculated based on the person's subtotal. A grand total will be determined for each person.
